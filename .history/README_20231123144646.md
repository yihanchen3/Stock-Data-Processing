# Stock Data Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter notebook `stock_data.ipynb` that performs various data analysis and forecasting on stock data. In this notebook, we will perform data analysis and visualization on the SPAC dataset. We will explore various aspects of the data and generate visualizations to gain insights.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

## Description

The notebook performs the following operations:

1.**Data Loading**: Loads the stock data from a CSV file.

2.**Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and formats the data for analysis.

3.**Data Analysis**: Calculates the Abnormal Returns, Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR), and Buy-and-Hold Abnormal Returns (BHAR) for a specific period.

4.**Data Visualization**: Plots the calculated returns for visual analysis.

5.**Forecasting**: Uses a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model to forecast the returns of SPAC and RUSSELL 2000 for the next 30 days.

6.**Plotting Forecasted Returns**: Plots the forecasted returns for visual analysis.

## Main Steps

1. Histogram of Net Increase of SPAC Completions Each Month

- Resample the data by month and count the number of SPAC completions.
- Plot a histogram to visualize the net increase of SPAC completions each month.

2. Pie Chart of SPACs Successfully Listed on Yahoo Finance

- Filter the SPAC dataset for IPOs between the earliest completion date and a set end date.
- Check the availability of each SPAC on Yahoo Finance.
- Plot a pie chart to show the portion of SPACs successfully listed on Yahoo Finance.

3. Daily Returns and Close Prices of SPACs by GICS Sectors

- Calculate the daily returns of SPACs and map them to GICS sectors.
- Plot the daily returns and close prices of SPACs by GICS sectors.
- Emphasize the Electric Vehicle sector in the plot.

4. Average Daily Returns of SPACs Over Time

- Calculate the average daily returns of SPACs.
- Plot the average daily returns of SPACs over time.

5. Volume and Share Price of SPACs Over Time

- Plot the volume and share price of SPACs over time.
- Use a dual-axis plot to show the relationship between volume and share price.

6. SPAC Share Price and VIX Over Time

- Plot the share price of SPACs and the VIX index over time.
- Use a dual-axis plot to show the relationship between share price and VIX.

7. Abnormal Returns and Cumulative AR of SPACs

- Calculate the abnormal returns and cumulative AR of SPACs.
- Plot the abnormal returns and cumulative AR of SPACs over time.

8. Regression Analysis

- Perform regression analysis to analyze the relationship between SPAC returns and market benchmarks.
- Calculate the coefficients and significance levels of the regression models.

9. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Analysis

- Plot the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of SPAC returns.
- Analyze the autocorrelation patterns and identify potential ARIMA models.

10. Forecasting SPAC Returns

- Use ARIMA and VAR models to forecast the future returns of SPACs.
- Plot the forecasted returns for the next month using both models.
